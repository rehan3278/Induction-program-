###It was a very grateful experience on 30th July, as it was my first day at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College in the Mechanical Engineering department.
The day began with an induction program, which started energetically at the Gurdwara Sahib. After the paath, there was a well-organized snacks party, which everyone enjoyed.

After having some snacks, we headed to the auditorium. The atmosphere there was filled with positive vibes. Several inspiring speeches were delivered, each carrying meaningful messages for us. Our Principal Sir also shared a fantastic message that motivated us greatly.

The Chief Guest for the event was Sardar Maheshinder Singh Grewal, the former Cabinet Minister of Punjab and a trust member of Nankana Sahib. He also shared his valuable thoughts and experiences with us.

After the session in the auditorium, we had a tour of our college campus. Overall, it was an amazing and fabulous experienceâ€”one I will always remember.
